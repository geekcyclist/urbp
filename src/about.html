            <h2>Our History</h2>
            <p>The Utah Refugee Bike Project began in 2021 when a group of friends noticed that some refugee
                families in our community lacked the resources to provide bicycles for their children. Instead, many kids
                were hanging around parks and playgrounds using a single bike. We hope to fill a gap left by organizations,
                and instead focus on recreational cycling for children.</p>
            <p>In our first few months we repaired and donated only a handful of bikes as a loose knit circle of friends
                and cycling enthusiasts. In the fall of 2021 we incorporated as a 501c3. Since then we've had a goal of
                repairing and distributing 100 bicycles a year. At the same time, whenever we distribute bikes we try to
                hold a maintenance and repair clinic in order to keep the bikes that kids already have in good working
                condition.</p>
            <p>Today we work with local refugee resettlement agencies and other nonprofits to build a network of
                dedicated volunteers who help collect, repair, and distribute bikes to families in need.</p>
