                <div class="subpage-item">
                    <h3>What kinds of bikes do you accept?</h3>
                    <p>We accept bikes of all sizes, but especially need children's bikes and small adult bikes. The bikes should be in repairable condition - they don't need to work perfectly, but should have their main components.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="subpage-item">
                    <h3>Where can I drop off a bike?</h3>
                    <p>Use the Get Involved link above to contact us and we can arrange pick-up or a drop-off point for your donation.</p>

                    <h3>Do you pick up bike donations?</h3>
                    <p>For multiple bikes or those unable to transport bikes, we can arrange pickup. Please Use the Get Involved link above to schedule a pick-up.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="subpage-item">
                    <h3>What do you do with bikes you can't repair?</h3>
                    <p>Sometimes we have bikes that are not repairable, either due to the condition, or the relative cost of parts. In those cases we either strip the bike for usable parts, or donate to one of our partner groups like the Salt Lake Bicycle Collective.</p>

                <div class="subpage-item">
                    <h3>What do you do with large adult bicycles?</h3>
                    <p>Donations of adult bicycles are happily accepted. We sometimes have large teens or adults on our list who can use larger bicycles. We may also offer your bicycle for sale on local classified sites and use the proceeds to fund repair part and tool purchases.</p>

                    <h3>Do I need mechanical experience?</h3>
                    <p>No! While we welcome experienced mechanics, we have many roles for non-mechanical volunteers, and we can teach basic repair skills to those interested in learning.</p>
